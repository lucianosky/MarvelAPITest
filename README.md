#  Marvel API Test
MarvelAPITest is an implementation of a native iOS App in Swift. It is a test app regarding UX/UI, MVVM architecture, API usage and unit testing. 

This project uses the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) to access their superheroes' data. If you use this implementation, you should register your own API key at Marvel.

## Packages
Dependency manager used was Cocoapods. Instructions for usage is available in their [documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/). Packages used in the project are:
* Alamofire
* Kingfisher

## Unit test
Unit test coverage at this point: 90%

## UX/UI
It is my belief that all iOS (or native mobile developers) should understand and practice some UX and UI. In this project the UX concept was mine, with the intent to create an app with the look and feel of a Comic Book. The UI was created by Flavia Ampessan.
